# Flayout

**NOTE: This is in Alpha, still under development.**


Fluid Layout provides a simple approach to implement resizable panes with a few lines of Javascript and CSS using the standard [Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API)

# Why?
Because I haven't found anything simple, lightweight and scalable. Seems like people tend to over-engineer things nowadays.
